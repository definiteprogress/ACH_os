Intel - 16bit real mode:
-------------------------
Interrupts:
------------

0x19 - will load and execute the bootloader (i.e finds the Boot Sector)
0x10 - prints character on screen
0x12 - gets the memory details from BIOS
0x13 - Function 0 -resets Floppy disk by calling BIOS
       Function 0x02 - read sectors into memory


In summary, there are 512 bytes per sector, 18 sectors per track, and 80 tracks per side.

Additional information:

    1. Each Track is useually divided into 512 byte sectors. On floppies, there are 18 sectors per track.
    2. A Cylinder is a group of tracks with the same radius (The Red tracks in the picture above are one cylinder)
    3. Floppy Disks have two heads (Displayed in the picture)
    4. There is 2880 Sectors total.



System Algorithm:
------------------
1. Laptop power switch ON, that triggers signal to the motherboard.
2. Motherboard gives control to powersupply, which inturn calls the routine "POST" to 
   check if all i/o devices gets sufficient power.POST long jumps to 0xFFFF00 where
   BIOS is located.
3. BIOS checks input/ouputs devices,sets up Interrupt Vector Table(IVT) and executes
   interrupt 0x19, which is a interrupt to find boot sector ( or in plain text finds the
   bootable device or disk with the help of the magic Boot signature 0xAA55 in byte 511 and 512)
4. if in byte 511 - 0xAA, 512 - 0x55, INT 0x19 will load and execute the bootloader.
5. The BIOS in this case(x86 processor) finds the stage 1 bootloader at address 0x7C00.
6. OEM parameter block which describes about FAT12 file system is mentioned in asm file.
7. Resets floppy disc using 0x13 BIOS interrupt, function 0. Accumulator is set with sector address
   0x1000:0000. Interrupt to read the floppy sector is enabled using 0x13 BIOS interrupt, function 2
8. Control is passed from sector 1 to sector 2 using jump 0x1000:0x0
9. cli , hlt for the time being in sector 2(stage 2 bootloader).
